### Project Description
In this project, we created a data visualizer tool that takes in user input to first select a type of visualization and has the user to input the variables which will be plotted on the chosen visualization. We constructed this program/tool around data from one of our members Nellie's micro crochet business on instagram, in which she had recorded the relevant variables of each post she created from over 3 years ago.

### Packages + Versions Used
The following packages were employed to complete this project:
- pandas 1.4.2
- numpy 1.23.5
- matplotlib 3.5.1
- functools 3.9

### Demo File Instructions
(How to run it, expected outputs, and any explanations/interpretations of the results + 2 figures of visualizations w/ titles, captions, and sufficient explanation in text here)
When you first run the demo file "Data Viz Program Demo"--which is a Jupyter notebook that imports the main crochet.py file--it begins by welcoming the user to the program and asking them to choose a number from the menu. The menu, numbered 0 to 5, lists 5 possible visualization options to choose from, as well as the choice to enter 0 to quit the program. 

Each vizualization can either take one or two variables (defined as the column names in the data spreadsheet) from the Instagram accounts' post dataset, depending on the visualization chosen and the types of data it is intended for. The arguments are poassed positionally, meaning that the order the column names are input will be received as predictor-outcome variable format and will be plotted on the x- and y- axises respectively. 

To specify, 
- The scatterplot intakes 2 variable arguments, ideally both of quantitative (numeric) nature
- The timeline takes 1 variable argument and plots it's behavior over the recorded years
- The histogram can take any number of variable arguments, at least one of numeric nature; plots the overlaid histograms on top of each other
- The boxplot takes 2 variable arguments, ideally x an y are quantitative 
- The barplot (bar chart) takes 2 variable arguments, ideally a categorical x and quantitative y 

Though there are ideal variables to be used in each kind of visualization, there are many instances in which the plotter program will execute and create a visually unappealing graph. Many combinations of column variables will plot without error despite not being intended to visualize that type of relationship, which can be either undersirable or entertaining depending on the intent for the program. 

To execute this program, all that needs to be done is first import the .py file containing the code with command 'import crochet' and then call the main function with '.' method notation: 'crochet.main()'; this will then initiate the program and cause the welcome prompt to appear. In the case that the tool needs to be started again—such as if 0 is entered into the main menu, quitting the tool, or if an error is generated which halts the programx—then calling the main function as specified in a new code cell can be used to launch the visualizer again; in working in a Jupyter workspace, restarting the kernel altogether works just as well too.

^ Above is an example of a scatterplot generated by the progeram. It displays the positive numerical correlation between the number of likes each post recieves vs. the number of comments it recieves.

^ Here is an example of a boxplot generated by the program. The data shown explores how the season or weather has an impact on the number of likes a post recieves; however, it is important to know that this plots the total amount of likes for all posts created in a season rather than an average amount per a post in a particular season. This data was used to determine which season garners the most popularity for the shop without controlling for amounts of post in each season-it seemed to be spring and winter.

^ This is an example of the type of error that would be generated if too many or not enough column names are entered to be plotted onto the chosen visualization. As mentioned, this would inquire relauching the tool in a new code cell.


### Scope and Limitations
This program has a limited scope as it was specifically designed to be able to work with a single dataframe which was provided by group member @clarenellie. The program is able to analyze social media data for a microbusiness which sells and posts about crochet items. The program will not provide very specific insights for an individuals personal account but it may do a good job for data from another business account, assuming the dataframe is formatted the same as the Clare Cox Crochet Social Media dataframe the program was designed for. 

Additionally, this tool is intended to observe relationships in the data recorded, rather than concretely make conclusions about causality. The data is essentially kept in it's "raw" form, meaning no manipulations were made to alter the nature of info, such as calculating and using the means for a variable. This tool only graphs the data as it was recorded. Possible extensions for the program: creating and implementing a class ot fit the best model for the inputted variables, functions to display statistical calculations (e.g., correlation coefficient), and exception handling for plotting the entered column names so that the program reprompts the user instead of halting.

### Background of Dataset 
This data was hand-collected over the course of 3 years by Nellie Cox. Everytime she created a post on the business account @clarecox.crochet, she hand-recorded all relevant information to describe the post, such as date posted, the type of item featured, likes received, comments, saves, etc. This amounted to a total of 19 recorded variables/columns, which turned into 17 possible variables within the scope of this program after servicing the data. 

## Extra Credit Demo Video
This is all 3 of us demoing executing the program and using the data vizualizer tool:
