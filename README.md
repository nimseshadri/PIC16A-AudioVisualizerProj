### Project Description
In this project, we created a data visualizer tool that takes in user input to first select a type of visualization and has the user to input the variables which will be plottef on the chosen visualization.

The following packages were employed to complete this project:
- pandas 1.4.2
- numpy 1.23.5
- matplotlib 3.5.1
